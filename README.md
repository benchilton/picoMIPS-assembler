# picoMIPs-assembler



## Getting started

This tool was designed for use as a part of a coursework during my degree.

The task of the coursework was to create a minimalistic picoRISC (picoMIPs) core using the minimum amount of hardware.
This assembler does not support LW or SW instructions as the picoRISC does not have any data memory.
